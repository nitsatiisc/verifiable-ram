	\section{Artifact Appendix}
	
%	\emph{The Artifact Appendix is meant to summarize the purpose,
%		availability, content, dependencies, and execution of the artifacts
%		that support your paper.  It should include a clear description of
%		your artifacts' hardware, software, and configuration requirements.
%		If your artifacts have received the \emph{Artifacts
%			Evaluated--Functional}, \emph{Artifacts Evaluated--Reusable}, or
%		\emph{Results Reproduced} badge, this appendix should summarize the
%		relevant major claims made by your paper and provide instructions for
%		validating each claim through the use of your artifacts.  Linking the
%		claims of your paper to the artifacts allows a reader of your paper
%		to more easily try to reproduce your paper's results.}
%	
%	\emph{Please fill in all the mandatory sections, keeping their titles
%		and organization but removing the current illustrative content, and
%		remove the optional sections that do not apply to your artifacts.}
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	\subsection{Abstract}
	
%	\emph{[Mandatory]}
%	%
%	\emph{Provide a short description of your artifacts.  What do they
%		contain?  How are they packaged?  What do they do when executed?  What
%		results to they produce?  How are your artifacts licensed?  Be brief;
%		subsequent sections of this appendix can be used fill in the details.}

	In this artifact appendix, we describe a repository(~\cite{}, packaged as a Zenodo record) that contains an implementation of \textit{lookup arguments from updatable tables} as detailed in our paper~\cite{full-ver}. This project contains a proof of concept implementation of the above paper and has not received any formal audit. It should not be used production. The repository is a fork of the original implementation of Caulk~\cite{} sub-vector lookup argument available at~\cite{}. We re-use many components such proof transcripts and algebraic algorithms from the Caulk implementation. 
	
	This artifact consists of Rust code, which when executed, reproduces benchmarks for updatable lookup arguments described in our paper. The remainder of the document gives a tutorial introduction to the code, and how to run and reproduce these benchmarks.
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	\subsection{Description \& Requirements}
	
%	\emph{This section should further detail your artifacts and summarize
%		the requirements that must be met for a person to recreate an
%		experimental environment for utilizing your artifacts.  Where
%		applicable, state the minimum hardware and software requirements for
%		running your artifacts.  It is also good practice to list and describe
%		in this section benchmarks where those are part of, or simply have
%		been used to produce results with, your artifacts.}

	We begin by presenting a high-level overview of the artifact~\cite{}. As mentioned earlier, the artifact consists of a repository that is a fork of the original implementation of Caulk~\cite{} sub-vector lookup argument available at~\cite{}. Below, we provide of how the artifact is organized. Please see the readme.md in the Zenodo record for more details.
	

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Several new algebraic algorithms for polynomial interpolation and evaluation are added to src/single/dft.rs on top of the existing algorithms from the Caulk repository.
		
		\item Several new algebraic algorithms for polynomial interpolation and evaluation are added to src/single/dft.rs on top of the existing algorithms from the Caulk repository.
		
		\item Implementation of CQ lookup protocol based on the paper CQ, with additional option of computing CQ lookup argument using pre-processed parameters for an "approximate" table. This code appears in the file src/ramlookup/cq.rs.
		
		\item A fast algorithm for computing scalar coefficients for computing the additive encoded quotient on top of the base CQ cached quotient. This appears in src/ramlookup/fastupdate.rs.
		An implementation of polynomial protocol for memory consistency appears in src/ramlookup/mod.rs. Currently, the protocols for checking well formation of time ordered transcript and address ordered transcript are implemented. We hope to implement remaining protocols in the future, but they are not critical to overall benchmarks, as these are over much smaller tables.

	\subsubsection{Security, privacy, and ethical concerns}
	
	There are no security, privacy, or ethical concerns related to this artifact. 
	
	%%%%%
	
	\subsubsection{How to access}
	
	\emph{[Mandatory]}
	%
	\emph{Describe how to access your artifacts.  If your artifacts have
		received the \emph{Artifacts Available} badge, you must provide the
		DOI(s) for the permanently and publicly available copies of your
		artifacts.  Most likely, this is the version of your artifacts that
		you deposited with Zenodo.}
	
	\emph{You may describe more than one way to access your artifacts.
		For example, if the archived versions of your artifacts are available
		at Zenodo, and you are also making maintained versions of your
		artifacts available through GitHub, you can describe how to access
		both versions of your artifacts.}
	
	%%%%%
	
	\subsubsection{Hardware dependencies}
	
	\emph{[Mandatory]}
	%
	\emph{State any specific hardware features that are required to make
		use of your artifacts: e.g., vendor, CPU/GPU/FPGA, number of
		processors/cores, microarchitecture, interconnect, memory, hardware
		counters, etc.  If your artifacts do not have significant hardware
		dependencies, simply write ``None'' in this section.}
	
	%%%%%
	
	\subsubsection{Software dependencies}
	
	\emph{[Mandatory]}
	%
	\emph{State any specific OS and software packages that are required to
		make use of your artifacts.  This is particularly important if you
		share your source code and it must be compiled, or if your artifacts
		rely on proprietary software that is not included in your artifact
		packages.  If your artifacts do not have significant software
		dependencies, simply write ``None'' in this section.}
	
	%%%%%
	
	\subsubsection{Benchmarks}
	
	\emph{[Mandatory]}
	%
	\emph{Describe any data (e.g., datasets, models, workloads,
		etc.)\ required by the experiments that are reported in your paper and
		supported by your artifacts.  If this does not apply to your
		artifacts, simply write ``None'' in this section.}
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	\subsection{Set Up}
	
	\emph{This section should summarize the installation and configuration
		steps that a person should follow to prepare an environment for making
		use of your artifacts.  If the set-up steps are complicated, point the
		reader to the places in your artifacts where detailed set-up
		instructions can be found.}
	
	%%%%%
	
	\subsubsection{Installation}
	
	\emph{[Mandatory]}
	%
	\emph{Provide instructions for downloading and installing dependencies
		as well as the main artifacts.  After following these steps, a user of
		your artifacts should be able to run a simple functionality test.}
	
	%%%%%
	
	\subsubsection{Basic test}
	
	\emph{[Mandatory]}
	%
	\emph{Provide instructions for running a simple functionality test.
		This test does not need to exercise all the features of your
		artifacts, but ideally, it should allow a user to check that all of
		the required software components are correctly installed and
		functioning as intended.  Please include the expected successful
		output and any required input parameters.}
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	\subsection{Evaluation Workflow}
	
	\emph{This section should include all the operational steps and
		experiments that a person must be carry out to utilize in your
		artifacts toward the goal of validating your paper's key results and
		claims.  To that end, we ask you to use the two following subsections
		and cross-reference the items therein as explained below.}

		presented in your paper.  A broad objective of artifact evaluation is
		to encourage you to make your research artifacts reusable by others.}
	
	\emph{Include in this section any instructions, guidance, or advice
		that you believe would help others reuse your artifacts.  For example,
