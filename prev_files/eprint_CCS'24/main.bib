	abstract="We propose a dynamic accumulator scheme from bilinear pairings and use it to construct an identity-based (ID-based) ring signature scheme with constant-size signatures and to provide membership revocation to group signature schemes, identity escrow schemes and anonymous credential systems. The ID-based ring signature scheme and the group signature scheme have very short signature sizes. The size of our group signatures with membership revocation is only half the size of those in the well-known ACJT00 scheme, which does not provide membership revocation. The schemes do not require trapdoor, so system parameters can be shared by multiple groups belonging to different organizations. All schemes are provably secure in formal models. We generalize the definition of accumulators and provide formal models for ID-based ad-hoc anonymous identification schemes and identity escrow schemes with membership revocation.",
