In this section we report on the experimental evaluation of our batching efficient RAM.
In addition, we also report on the overhead (as a function of changes since last parameter computation)
incurred by our updatable lookup arguments over the vanilla lookup arguments with read-only table. We
benchmark this overhead over vanilla implementations of Caulk+ ~\cite{EPRINT:PosKat22} and
CQ ~\cite{EPRINT:EagFioGab22}, both of which we also implement (as their non zero-knowledge variants)
for our evaluation. Our implementation is built on top of existing implementation ~\cite{caulk-implementation}
of lookup argument Caulk ~\cite{CCS:ZBKMNS22}. We make our implementation available at
\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/updatableRAM/} for anonymous submission. We later plan to
make the implementation available as open-source project.
