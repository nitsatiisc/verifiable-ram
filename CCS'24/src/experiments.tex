In this section we report on the experimental evaluation of our batching efficient RAM.
In addition, we also report on the overhead (as a function of changes since last parameter computation)
incurred by our updatable lookup arguments over the vanilla lookup arguments with read-only table. We
benchmark this overhead over vanilla implementations of Caulk+ ~\cite{EPRINT:PosKat22} and
CQ ~\cite{EPRINT:EagFioGab22}, both of which we also implement (as their non zero-knowledge variants)
for our evaluation. Our implementation is built on top of existing implementation ~\cite{caulk-implementation}
of lookup argument Caulk ~\cite{CCS:ZBKMNS22}. We make our implementation available at
\url{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/updatableRAM/} for anonymous submission. We later plan to
make the implementation available as open-source project.
All the benchmarks were run single-threaded on a commodity configuration featuring a $2.1GHz$ Intel-I5 processor,
$16$ GB memory running Ubuntu Linux 22.04. The implementation was compiled using {\tt --release}
flag in Rust. Generating table specific parameters for table of size $1$ million takes around $12,000$
seconds for CQ based instantiation.

We first provide overall running time of batching efficient RAM primitive instantiated with Caulk+
and CQ lookup arguments. The degradation in running time is plotted as function of accumulated updates
since the last computation of full table-specific parameters in Figure ~\ref{fig:batch-ram-proving-time}.
We choose batch size of $m=128$ for Caulk+ based instantiation (to avoid prohibitive performance),
while we consider $m=1024$ for CQ based instantiation. Our overhead remains barely noticable against
the quadratic costs incurred by Caulk+ base protocol till about $2^{15}$ accumulated changes, equivalent of
$128$ lookups of size $512$. While the performance overhead compared to base CQ protocol is much more apparent,
overall we continue to achieve online proof generation time of under a minute all the way upto
$\approx 2\times 10^5$ accumulated changes, equivalent of roughly $200$ batch updates (assuming the worst-case
scenario). In real application scenarios, we can expect better degradation curve, as its unlikely that updates
to the table occur uniformly across all positions.

In Figure ~\ref{fig:batch-ram-constraints}, we compare the
R1CS constraints incurred by existing approaches to batching friendly RAMs/accumulators. For our work, we assume
that the memory checking on the RAM instance of size $m$ is implemented as an arithmetic circuit using a Bene's
routing network ~\cite{benes}, though we also provide a purely polynomial protocol for the same in Section ~\ref{sec:poly-proto-ram-app}.
Our construction is relatively ``circuit-free'' and relies on the efficiency of lookup arguments coupled with
our novel modifications to make them update resilient.

Finally, we also compare the efficacy of our quasi-linear algorithm to compute scalar coefficients in
Lemma ~\ref{lem:sum-computation}, required to assemble the encoded quotients from pre-computed quotients.
This algorithm is implemented and tested in the {\tt fastupdate} module of the referenced repository.
In Table ~\ref{tbl:sum-computation-compare}, we compare it against the naive computation of the quotients.
In the table, we vary the sizes of set $I$ in Lemma ~\ref{lem:sum-computation} in the set $\{2^i:7\leq i\leq 10\}$
and set $K=2^7|I|$, i.e, we compare the two methods to sustain $\approx 100$ online proofs. We clearly see
$5\times-20\times$ advantage over the naive computation.
