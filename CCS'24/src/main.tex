		Persistent RAM (random access memory) is a useful primitive in verifiable computation.
		The persistent RAM primitive allows one to efficiently verify that execution of a program $\mathcal{P}$
		with read/write access to memory state $\mathsf{st}_0$ results in the final state $\mathsf{st}_1$.
		The efficiency requires that verification is cheaper than naive execution of $\mathcal{P}$
		(typically poly-logarithmic) and only requires access to {\em succinct} digests (e.g. Merkle hash) of the state(s).
		Persistence refers to the fact that state digests allow proving updates to the state across several computations
		in an incremental fashion.
		
		Current approaches realizing persistent RAM in verifiable computation generally use Merkle-trees
		or cryptographic accumulators based on unknown-order groups (RSA, class-groups) to compress the state. The
		Merkle-tree based approaches suffer from high concrete costs due to poor batching properties, leading to
		verification of several hash function evaluations inside VC circuits. While the accumulator based approaches
		offer significant improvement for bigger batch sizes, they still incur computations linear in the size of the
		accumulated set to compute witnesses for inclusion proofs.
		
		In this paper, we present a polynomial protocol that realizes an improved persistent RAM primitive, building
		on the techniques used in recent lookup arguments with table size independent prover complexity.
		The RAM state and updates are suitably represented as polynomials, and proving correctness of the state update
		reduces to proving identities over related polynomials.
		These can be compiled into succinct non-interactive arguments
		of knowledge (SNARK) using a polynomial commitment scheme like \textsf{KZG} under the Algebraic Group Model (AGM) and
		the Random Oracle model. Amortized cost of proving correctness of a batch of $m$ updates for RAM of size $N$ is
		$O(m^2)$ field operations and a multi-exponentiation of size $O(\sqrt{mN})$, thus achieving sublinear $(\sqrt{N})$
		dependence on the RAM size. We also show that our approach outperforms existing approaches in practice and
		experimentally validate superior performance of our primitive when applied to blockchain rollups.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
General purpose {\em Succinct Non-interactive Arguments of Knowledge} (SNARKs) enable one to generate succinct
proofs of membership of a statement in an $\npol$ relation expressed as an arithmetic circuit. These proofs are
extremely cheap to verify, which makes them useful for {\em Verifiable Computation} (VC), where a low-powered
client (e.g. mobile phone), can outsource an expensive computation to an untrusted server, and later
verify the correctness of the results at a minimal cost.
However,
arithmetic circuit based representations are inefficient in expressing relations involving the result of
a program execution on memory/state, which frequently arise in the context of verifiable computation.
These include scenarios such as proving the correctness of a query execution against a database,
proving the correctness of inference
from a decision tree, or proving correct update of table of account balances when a batch of transactions (e.g. transfers)
are applied to it.
In aforementioned examples, database tables, decision trees and accounts table are naturally
modelled as addressable memory and one needs to prove that it is accessed/updated in accordance with the correct execution
of the computation. Accordingly, there is a rich and expanding body of work to efficiently model the abstraction of
addressable memory in verifiable computations. While complete acknowledgement of this vast body of work is beyond
the scope of this paper (a fairly recent survey in \cite{WB15} is a good starting point) we summarise key approaches towards
modelling RAM in verifiable computation. Often we demand additional properties of the RAM primitive, such as
{\em persistence} - which is the ability to persist the RAM state across several computations, and {\em batching} -
where verifiable update of the RAM state is required for small batches of updates. These properties are also
the focus of this work.

Batching efficient RAM primitive is especially relevant in the context of blockchain {\em rollups} ~\cite{rollup},
an umbrella term for recent efforts to scale blockchains
by moving expensive computation off the blockchain to the so-called {\em layer two} or L2 chains. The blockchain
only needs to verify the succinct proofs attesting to the correctness of the off-chain computation. This approach
is popularly called rollup as it allows verifying the result of several (rolled-up) transactions
modifying the L2 state, as part of one transaction verified on the main chain.
This simultaneously helps the scalability and lowers the cost (e.g. gas fees)
per transaction due to succinct verification.
We consider improving efficiency of rollups an important
motivation for our work, though in this work we do not go into precise details of a smart-contract based
instantiation of our solution.

\subsection{Our work}\label{subsec:ourwork}
We present batching efficient RAM construction, which advances the efforts
towards achieving {\em verifiable outsourcing of state update} such as in ~\cite{EPRINT:BFRSBW13}
and more recently in ~\cite{USENIX:OWWB20, CCS:CFHKKO22}.
The most popular approaches to succinctly represent
state involve accumulators based on Merkle-trees ~\cite{C:Merkle87}, or ones based on groups of unknown order
(e.g. RSA, class-groups) ~\cite{C:CamLys02,C:BonBunFis19,USENIX:OWWB20, CCS:CFHKKO22}.
The updates to the state are effected by insertions or deletions in the  accumulated set.
By contrast, in this work we
model the state as an addressable memory (RAM) described by vector $\vecT$, which stores a value $v_i$ at address $i$.
We denote this as $\vecT[\,i\,]=v_i$. The RAM supports two operations, viz, {\em loads} expressed
as $v_i := \vecT[\,i\,]$, and {\em stores} expressed as $\vecT[\,i\,]=v_i$.
%denoted by the tuple $(\load, i, v_i)$ and (ii) {\em indexed update} ($\vecT[\,i\,] := v_i$), denoted
%by the tuple $(\store, i, v_i)$.
We think of addresses $i\in [0,N]$ for some $N\in \mathbb{Z}$ while the
values $v_i\in \F$ for some finite field $\F$. In our construction, we represent both the RAM and operations on it
as polynomials, and use appropriate polynomial commitment schemes to obtain succinct commitments (digests) to them.
In this paper, we do not require commitments to be {\em hiding}, as our focus is on succinctness.
We consider privacy as an orthogonal goal, one we believe is easily achievable
via small adaptations to our construction.

\begin{comment}
\noindent{\bf Application to Blockchain Rollups}: We consider the application of persistent RAM primitive to a common rollup scenario.
Our application is a simplified adaptation of rollup protocols such as ZkSync ~\cite{ZkSync}.
We assume a layer two (L2) chain \textsf{DemoChain}, which issues its clients \textsf{DemoCoins}. The clients have accounts on
L2, and they transfer \textsf{DemoCoins} to each other using L2 transactions. Such a system will also have mechanism to transfer
funds to and from main-chain (e.g. Ethereum) accounts, but we
ignore those details here.
Each client is assigned a unique identifier $i$, and associated account information  is maintained as
a tuple $(\pk_i,\bal_i,\txno_i)$ which refer respectively to the public key for verifying client's signature on transactions,
account balance (number of coins owned by the client) and total number of transactions made from the account (to prevent replay attacks).
The L2 state thus consists of the above information for all accounts. We model an L2 chain supporting upto $N$ accounts as a RAM $\vecT$
of size $N$, where $\vecT[\,i\,]=(\pk_i,\bal_i,\txno_i)$ denotes client $i$'s account information. A transfer transaction of amount $v$
from client $i$ to client $j$ involves two load operations, and two store operations on the RAM (for reading and updating the referenced
accounts). These transactions are submitted by clients directly to a designated L2 chain operator \textsf{DemoOperator}, who batches $m$
such transactions and updates the RAM state accordingly. The operator maintains the entire state off-chain and locally computes the updates for
each batch of transactions. Only the succinct digest of the state (polynomial commitments) is stored on the main chain, and the proof of
validity of the state update is verified by a main-chain transaction. In later sections, we provide more details on the application and the
performance achieved when instantiated using our primitive.
\end{comment}
\subsection{Techniques}\label{subsec:techniques}
\noindent{\bf Update friendly lookup arguments}: Starting point for our work are the recent lookup arguments which prove
that a vector of size $m$ appears as
a sub-vector in a large fixed vector (table) of size $N$ with succinct proof sizes and verification, but most notably
ensuring that prover runs in time sub-linear in the size of the table ($N$). The pioneering work ~\cite{CCS:ZBKMNS22}
obtained prover complexity of $O(m^2+m\log N)$, which was improved in subsequent works to $O(m^2)$ ~\cite{EPRINT:PosKat22},
$O(m\log^2 m)$ ~\cite{EPRINT:ZGKMR22}, and $O(m\log m)$ ~\cite{EPRINT:EagFioGab22}. However, the sub-linear prover
complexity requires table-dependent $O(N\log N)$ pre-processing and $O(N)$ storage. This table-dependent
pre-processing implies that while
the aforementioned lookup arguments can be used to obtain efficient ROM (read only memory) semantics
%\footnote{The protocols for sub-vector relation in ~\cite{CCS:ZBKMNS22, EPRINT:ZGKMR22} also implicitly support indexed lookup semantics},
they cannot be used as is for RAM (which supports update operations).
Moreover, an update involving even a single
index renders the entire $O(N)$ pre-processing unusable for further lookups,
thus necessitating entire $O(N\log N)$ re-computation. This work is the first effort towards
mitigating this rigid dependence, thereby increasing the applicability of the recent lookup arguments.
An important contribution we make here is a new method for computing ``encoded quotients'' used in several
recent lookup constructions such as ~\cite{CCS:ZBKMNS22,EPRINT:PosKat22,EPRINT:EagFioGab22}.
Our approach for computing these quotients from pre-computed parameters remains efficient even when
the table is updated, and it directly applies to all the aforementioned constructions.
For a table $\delta$-hamming distance away from the pre-processed one, we incur
$(m+\delta)\log^2(m+\delta)$ additional overhead for proving $m$ lookups. This additive and quasi-linear
overhead in $\delta$ rests on novel algebraic algorithms described in Section ~\ref{sec:update-protocol}.
We informally summarise our contribution in this regard below, whereas Theorem ~\ref{thm:approx-setup}
states the precise result.
\begin{theorem}[Informal]\label{thm:pre-process}
	There exists a deterministic $O(N\log N)$ time algorithm $\textsf{Preprocess}(\vecT)\outp \pp_T$
	which on input $\vecT\in \F^N$, outputs parameters $\pp_T$ of size $O(N)$ such
	that: Given $\pp_T$, vectors $\vecT'\in \F^N$, $\vec{t}\in \F^m$ with $\vec{t}$ being a sub-vector of $\vecT'$
	an argument of knowledge for the same can be computed in time
	$O((m+\delta)\log^2 (m+\delta) + f(m))$ where $\delta=\Delta(\vecT, \vecT')$
	is the hamming distance of $\vecT$ and $\vecT'$ while $f(m)$ depends on the specific lookup protocol.
\end{theorem}
For the constructions ~\cite{CCS:ZBKMNS22,EPRINT:PosKat22}, we set $f(m)=m^2$ in the above,
while for ~\cite{EPRINT:EagFioGab22}, we have $f(m)=m\log m$.\smallskip

\noindent{\bf Committed Index Lookup}: We augment the sub-vector relation in prior lookup arguments which
considers whether each entry of a given vector appears in the target vector to one that also identifies
the precise positions where the given vector appears in the target vector. When this relation is checked
over commitments of the respective vectors; given vector, the target vector and the position vector, we call
it {\em committed index lookup}. The relation we consider is similar to the one considered in ~\cite{lasso}.
For lookup arguments with homo-morphic commitment scheme, we show that committed index lookup can be obtained
using three instantiations of sub-vector lookup (Lemma ~\ref{lem:generic-transformation}). Such reduction was
also considered in ~\cite{lasso}, but under a more restrictive assumption on the elements in the table being
within a certain bound. The reduction readily implies
efficient constructions of arguments for committed index lookups from
~\cite{CCS:ZBKMNS22,EPRINT:PosKat22,EPRINT:ZGKMR22,EPRINT:EagFioGab22}.
In the case of ~\cite{EPRINT:PosKat22}, we give an explicit adaptation in
Section ~\ref{subsec:committed-index-lookup} that incurs costs comparable to single instance of the underlying sub-vector
protocol.

\noindent{\bf Polynomial Protocol for RAM}: Most of the efficient implementations of RAM in verifiable computation ~\cite{C:BCGTV13, NDSS:WSRBW15, SP:ZGKPP18}
rely on the {\em address-ordered transcript} to check that a sequence of $\load$s and $\store$s are {\em consistent} with some initial state
of the RAM. Using the tuple $(t,\op,\ind, v)$ to denote a RAM instruction with $t$ being the execution {\em timestamp}, $\op\in \{\load,\store\}$ being
the operation type, $\ind$ being the index referenced and $v$ denoting the value read/stored, a time ordered execution transcript $\mathsf{tr} = (\ins_1,\ldots,\ins_m)$ is a sequence
of instructions where $\ins_i=(t_i,\op_i,\ind_i, v_i)$ and $t_i < t_{i+1}$ for all $1\leq i<m$. The transcript $\mathsf{tr}$ is said to be consistent if
for every $\load$ instruction $\ins=(t,\load,\ind,v)$, the value $v$ is the same as that for the most recent $\store$ instruction, which references the same index
as $\ins$. This consistency can be efficiently checked by permuting the transcript $\mathsf{tr}$ to produce the sequence
$\mathsf{tr}^\ast=(\ins_1^\ast,\ldots,\ins_m^\ast)$ with $\ins_i^\ast=(t_i^\ast,\op_i^\ast,\ind_i^\ast,v_i^\ast)$ which is sorted by index, with
timestamp used to break the ties, i.e, $\ind_i^\ast\leq \ind_{i+1}^\ast$ and whenever $\ind_i^\ast=\ind_{i+1}^\ast$, we have $t_i^\ast < t_{i+1}^\ast$.
We call the resulting transcript $\mathsf{tr}^\ast$ as address ordered transcript. On such a transcript, the consistency is enforced simply by
checking that each $\load$ instruction involves the same value $v$ as the previous instruction, provided the referenced indices are the same.
The above approach is easily extended to verify that result of executing a sequence of operations $\{(\op_i,\ind_i,v_i)\}_{i=1}^m$ on
RAM $\vecT_0\in \F^n$ is $\vecT_1\in F^n$. In this case, we define a transcript $\mathsf{tr}=(\ins_1,\ldots,\ins_{2n+m})$ where the
first $n$ instructions $\ins_i,i\in [n]$ are defined as $\ins_i=(i,\store,i,\vecT_0[\,i\,])$, the next $m$ instructions are defined
as $\ins_{n+i},i\in [m]$ as $\ins_{n+i}=(n+i, \op_i, \ind_i, v_i)$ and the last $n$ instructions $\ins_{n+m+i}, i\in [n]$ as
$\ins_{n+m+i}=(n+m+i,\load,i,\vecT_1[\,i\,])$. The consistency of the transcript $\mathsf{tr}$ is checked via address ordering permutation as
described before. Intuitively, the first $n$ instructions in $\mathsf{tr}$ copy the initial contents of the RAM, the next $m$ instructions essentially
capture the sequence of RAM operations executed on the initial RAM, while the final $n$ instructions read out the entire contents of the RAM which
is expected to match the contents of $\vecT_1[\,i\,]$. We illustrate this approach in Figure \ref{fig:permutated-transcripts}. One of the contributions of this work is a polynomial protocol that proves that RAM state
$\vecT_1\in \F^n$ is obtained from RAM state $\vecT_0\in \F^n$ as a result of sequence of operations $\vec{\op}=\{(\op_i,\ind_i,v_i)\}_{i=1}^m$, where each
of the vectors $\vecT_0,\vecT_1$ and $\vec{\op}$ are represented via polynomials. Informally, we show:
\begin{theorem}[informal]\label{thm:pp-for-ram-informal}
	For $m,n\in \mathbb{N}$, there exists a polynomial protocol to prove that sequence of operations $\vec{\op}=\{(\op_i,\ind_i,v_i)\}_{i=1}^m$ updates a
	RAM state $\vecT_0\in \F^n$ to RAM state $\vecT_1\in \F^n$ with the prover-complexity of $\tilde{O}(m+n)$.
\end{theorem}

\noindent{\bf Improved RAM from Lookup Arguments}: The approach of the previous paragraph incurs a linear cost in
the size of the RAM, even though the number of operations $m$ could be much smaller $m\ll n$. To circumvent the
dependence on RAM size $n$, we use the efficient lookup arguments to isolate the part of RAM which is involved
in the operation sequence $\vec{\op}=\{(\op_i,\ind_i,v_i)\}_{i=1}^m$.
Concretely, from the vectors $\vecT_0,\vecT_1\in \F^n$ denoting the initial and final RAM states, we claim
vectors $\vec{t}_0, \vec{t}_1\in \F^m$ such that $\vec{t}_j[\,i\,] = \vecT_j[\,\ind_i\,]$ for all $i\in [m]$ and
$j=0,1$. Intuitively (modulo certain technicalities), we need to show that (i) the operation sequence $\vec{\op}$
transforms $\vec{t}_0$ to $\vec{t}_1$ and (ii) the RAMs $\vecT_0$ and $\vecT_1$ are identical at indices not
involved in $\vec{\op}$, i.e $\vecT_0[\,i\,]=\vecT_1[\,i\,]$ for $i\not\in \{\ind_i: i\in [m]\}$. In later
sections, we show that the latter check can be accomplished with $\tilde{O}(m)$ prover complexity. The former
check involves an adaptation of folklore approach using address ordered transcript (we consider additional subtleties such
as the possibility of multiple rows of $\vec{t}_0$ and $\vec{t}_1$ referring to the same index of their parent RAMs $\vecT_0$ and
$\vecT_1$ respectively).
In later sections, we show that this is efficiently handled by using the inherited indices in constructing the transcript showing
consistency of $\vec{t}_0$ and $\vec{t}_1$. Since the lookup protocol is $O(m^2)$ and the memory consistency check involves transcript
of size $O(m)$, the overall complexity of this step is $O(m^2)$. Figure ~\ref{fig:subtable-lookup} illustrates the above idea on
a concrete example.
%and ~\ref{fig:subtable-consistency}

	The approach in the previous paragraph yields an argument for RAM with
table-independent prover-complexity ($O(m^2)$), {\em provided} the prover has access to the table-dependent pre-processing
$\pp_{T,0}$ for the table $\vecT_0$. We also require lookup from table $\vecT_1$, but it differs from $\vecT_0$ in at most $m$
positions, so by Theorem \ref{thm:pp-for-ram-informal}, this lookup also requires $O(m^2)$ prover time. Next, let's suppose we apply an
update of $m$ operations to obtain $\vecT_2$ from $\vecT_1$, and incrementally obtain $\vecT_3,\ldots,\vecT_k$. By Theorem ~\ref{thm:pp-for-ram-informal},
the update $\vecT_k\rightarrow \vecT_{k+1}$ costs $O(m^2 + (mk)\log^2(mk))$. If we choose to re-compute the pre-processing parameters after $k$
batches (of $m$ updates each), the average cost per batch is $O(N\log N/k + m^2 + mk\log^2(mk))$. Setting $k\approx \sqrt{N/m}$ yields the
average cost of $m$ updates as $O(m^2+\sqrt{mN})$, which scales sub-linearly with the size of the RAM. While the preceding analysis considers
worst case, in specific applications (such as account transactions, where few accounts contribute a large volume of transactions), it may be
possible to further defer the computation of pre-processing parameters. Thus we have:

\begin{theorem}[Informal]\label{thm:inc-ver-ram-informal}
	Given $m,N\in \mathbb{N}$, there exists a polynomial protocol which incrementally proves updates of batch size $m$ on RAM of size $N$
	with amortized prover complexity of $O(m^2 + \sqrt{mN})$.
\end{theorem}
