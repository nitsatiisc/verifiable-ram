The construction in the previous section results in prover complexity which is quasi-linear in both the
size of the RAM and the number of operations.
Our goal in this section is to achieve prover complexity which is {\em sublinear} in the size of the RAM.
In what follows, let $N$ denote the size of the RAM (upper-case to signify it's large) and $m$ denote the number
of operations in a batch. We will use a vectors in $\F^N$ to denote the ``large'' RAMs, where index column is implicitly
assumed to be $(1,\ldots,N)$.
Let $\vec{T},\vec{T'}\in \F^N$ denote the initial and final RAM states, and let $\vec{o}$ be
a sequence of $m$ operations which updates $\vec{T}$ to $\vec{T}'$. Let $\vec{a}\in \F^m$ denote the vector
of RAM indices referenced by the operations in $\vec{o}$, i.e, $a_i$ is the index referenced by $i^{th}$ operation.
To prove the transformation of $\vec{T}$ to $\vec{T}'$ via operation sequence $\vec{o}$, we proceed as follows:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em, label=-]
    \item We isolate sub-tables $S=(\vec{a},\vec{v})$ and $S'=(\vec{a},\vec{a'})$ of $T$ and $T'$ consisting of
    rows corresponding to indices in $\vec{a}$. This requires proving $\vec{v}=\vecT[\vec{a}]$ and $\vec{v'}=
    \vecT'[\vec{a}]$, which we show using {\em committed index lookup} discussed in Section ~\ref{subsec:committed-index-lookup}.

    \item On the isolated sub-table $S$ and $S'$ of size $m$, we use the standard memory checking arguments (c.f. argument
    presented in Section \ref{sec:poly-proto-ram-app}) to prove that sequence $\vec{o}$ correctly updates $S$ to $S'$ with
    prover complexity of $\wt{O}(m)$.

    \item Finally, we show that the RAMs $T$ and $T'$ are identical outside indices in $\vec{a}$. We call them $\vec{a}$-identical
    and describe the protocol for proving the same in Section ~\ref{subsec:proximity-ram}.
\end{itemize}

    \caption{Illustrating different steps of sub-linear lookup protocol between large RAMs $\vecT$ and $\vecT'$.}
    \label{fig:blueprint}
\end{figure}

The blueprint for the above approach is illustrated in Figure ~\ref{fig:blueprint}.
The efficiency of the above approach relies crucially on the efficiency of committed index lookup used to
reduce the size of the RAMs for quasi-linear memory checking methods. It is tempting to use the recent lookup arguments
in ~\cite{CCS:ZBKMNS22,EPRINT:PosKat22,EPRINT:EagFioGab22} to prove the correctness of the first step with prover complexity dependent only on $m$.
However, employing them directly is difficult; their table-independent efficiency relies on
table specific expensive pre-computation, which does not help when the table is updatable. This is the problem we solve
in Section ~\ref{sec:update-protocol}, where we modify the prover algorithm for the lookup arguments to remain efficient
with access to pre-computed parameters for an ``approximate'' table.
\begin{comment} %repetition
In particular, we show that lookup protocols in
~\cite{CCS:ZBKMNS22,EPRINT:PosKat22,EPRINT:EagFioGab22} can be used to show $m$ lookups from a table $\vecT'$, given pre-computed parameters
for a table $\vecT$ with additional overhead of $O((m+\delta)\log^2 (m+\delta))$, where $\delta$ denotes the hamming distance
of tables $\vecT$ and $\vecT'$. By optimally deferring the $O(N\log N)$ re-computation till we
accumulate $\delta \approx \sqrt{mN}$ updates, we achieve an amortized prover overhead $O(\sqrt{mN})$ over the lookup protocols for non-updatable tables.
This modification described in ~\ref{sec:update-protocol} applies to all the aforementioned lookup protocols.
\end{comment}

\noindent{\bf Additional Notation}:
Before proceeding, we introduce the subgroup $\setN=\{\xi,\ldots,\xi^N\}$ consisting of $N^{th}$ roots of unity,
over which we encode vectors in $\F^N$ as polynomials of degree less than $N$. Let $\{\mu_i(X)\}_{i=1}^N$ be the associated
lagrange basis polynomials over the set $\setN$. We also recall the set $\setV$ consisting of $m^{th}$ roots of unity
$\nu,\ldots,\nu^m$ with associated lagrange polynomials as $\{\tau_i(X)\}_{i=1}^m$. For $\vec{f}\in \F^N$, let
$\enc{f}{\setN}$ denote the polynomial encoding of $\vec{f}$ over $\setN$ given by $\sum_{i=1}^N f_i\mu_i(X)$. Similarly,
for $\vec{g}\in \F^m$, let $\enc{g}{\setV}$ denote its polynomial encoding over $\setV$ given by $\sum_{i=1}^m g_i\tau_i(X)$. For
vectors $\vec{t}$, we sometimes use the index notation $\vec{t}[a_i]$ to denote $a_i^{th}$ element of the vector. For vectors
$\vec{t}$ and $\vec{a}$ we use the notation $\vec{t}[\,\vec{a}\,]$ to denote the vector $\vec{v}$ such that $v_i=\vec{t}[\,a_i\,]$ for all $i$.
\chaya{above can be pruned. some of it is already in prelims.}


\subsection{Committed Index Lookup}\label{subsec:committed-index-lookup}
Let $m,N\in \N$ be fixed parameters with $m < N$ and let $\srs$ denote a $\kzg$ setup of degree $d\geq N$
over bi-linear group $(\F$, $\Gone$, $\Gtwo$, $\GT$, $e$, $\gone{1}$, $\gtwo{1}$, $[1]_t)$. Recall that the committed index
lookup relation in Definition ~\ref{defn:comm-index-lookup} involves the prover showing knowledge of vectors $\vecT\in \F^N$,
$\vec{a}\in \F^m$ and $\vec{v}\in \F^m$ corresponding to public commitments $c_T, c_a$ and $c_v$ such that they
satisfy $v_i = \vecT[\,a_i\,] = T_{a_i}$.
We present a polynomial protocol for the same, which is an adaptation of the lookup protocol from Caulk+ ~\cite{EPRINT:PosKat22}.
However, here we do not aim for zero-knowledge. Let $T(X)=\enc{t}{\setN}$, $a(X)=\enc{a}{\setV}$ and
$v(X)=\enc{v}{\setV}$ denote the polynomials encoding the vectors $\vec{t},\vec{a}$ and $\vec{v}$ respectively.
The verifier knows commitments to these polynomials at the start of the protocol.
Now $v_i = \vec{t}[a_i]$ for $i\in [m]$ is equivalent to $v(\nu^i) = T(\xi^{a(\nu^i)})$ for $i\in [m]$. To
obtain a polynomial protocol, the prover interpolates a polynomial $h(X)=\sum_{i=1}^m \xi^{a_i}\tau_i(X)$, which satisfies
$h(\nu^i)=\xi^{a(\nu^i)}$. To show that polynomial $h$ correctly ``exponentiates'' evaluations of $a(X)$, we consider the
inverting polynomial $\ell(X)=\sum_{i=1}^N i\mu_i(X)$ which behaves like ``log'' over $\setN$ by evaluating to $i$ on $\xi^i$. Now, we see
that all constraints are encoded as polynomial identities below:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \ell(h(X)) &= a(X) \quad \text{mod } Z_{\setV}\\  % & \quad\text{ encodes } & \quad \forall i\in [m]:& h(\nu^i) = \xi^{a(\nu^i)}  \\
        T(h(X)) &= v(X) \quad \text{mod } Z_\setV \\ % \quad\text{ encodes } & \quad \forall i\in [m]:& v_i = \vec{t}[a_i] \\
        Z_{\setN}(h(X)) &= 0 \qquad \text{mod } Z_\setV  %&\quad\text{ encodes } & \quad \forall i \in [m]:& h(\nu^i)\in \setN
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:comm-index-lookup}
\end{equation}
The last polynomial identity ensures that evaluations of $h$ on $\setV$ lie in $\setN$ (the set of roots of $\vpolyN$). Since the polynomial $\ell$ is one-one
over $\setN$, the first equation implies $h(\nu^i)=\xi^{a_i}$ for all $i\in [m]$. The desired relation $v_i=T_{a_i}$ now follows from the second identity.
The above formulation involves composition with polynomials $\ell,T$ and $\vpolyN$ of degree $O(N)$, which is inefficient. We use the trick from
\cite{EPRINT:PosKat22}, where we work with low-degree restrictions of $O(N)$-degree polynomials such as $T, \ell$ over the set
$\setN_I=\{{h(\nu^i)}: i\in [m]\}=\{\xi^{a_i}:i\in I\}\subseteq \setN$, where $I=\{a_i: i\in [m]\}$. The prover
commits to the polynomials $Z_I(X)=\prod_{i\in I}(X-\xi^i)$, $h(X)$ and low degree ($<m$) restrictions $T_I, \ell_I$ of $T$ and $\ell$
on the $\setN_I$ respectively. The polynomial protocol then checks the following:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{alignedat}{3}
        T(X) - T_I(X) &= 0 \quad \text{ mod } Z_I ,&\quad& T_I(h(X)) &= v(X) \quad \text{ mod } Z_{\setV} \\
        \ell(X) - \ell_I(X) &= 0 \quad \text{ mod } Z_I ,&\quad& \ell_I(h(X)) &= a(X) \quad \text{ mod } Z_{\setV} \\
        Z_{\setN}(X) &= 0 \quad \text{ mod } Z_I ,&\quad& Z_I(h(X)) &= 0 \quad \text{ mod } Z_{\setV}
    \end{alignedat}
    \label{eq:poly-comm-index}
\end{equation}
It must be noted that the above identities imply the earlier polynomial identities in \eqref{eq:comm-index-lookup}. This is so because evaluations
of $h$ on $\setV$ are roots of $Z_I$, which implies $T_I(h(\nu^i))=T(h(\nu^i))$, $\ell_I(h(\nu^i))=\ell(h(\nu^i))$ and $\vpolyN(h(\nu^i))=0$ over $\setV$.
While the identities on the left still involve a degree $N$ polynomial, we can use the $\srs$ to check the polynomial
identity at the point $\tau$ encoded in the $\srs$. For example, we can evaluate the encoded quotient $\gtwo{Q(X)} =$
$\gtwo{\frac{(T(X) - T_I(X)}{Z_I(X)}}$ using the relation:
\begin{equation*}
    \gtwo{\frac{T(X)-T_I(X)}{Z_I(X)}} = \sum_{i\in I}\frac{1}{Z_I'(\xi^i)}\gtwo{\frac{T(X)-t_i}{X-\xi^i}}
\end{equation*}
By pre-computing the $\kzg$ proofs $W_1^i=\gtwo{\frac{T(X)-t_i}{X-\xi^i}}$ for all $i\in [N]$, the encoded quotient can be
evaluated using $O(m)$ $\Gtwo$-operations and $O(m\log^2 m)$ $\F$-operations.
The identity is then checked using a real pairing check
$$e(\gone{T(X)}-\gone{T_I(X)},\gtwo{1})=e(\gone{Z_I(X)},\gtwo{Q(X)}).$$
Similarly, we also pre-compute the encoded
quotients $W_2^i=\gtwo{\frac{\ell(X) - i}{X-\xi^i}}$ and $W_3^i=\gtwo{\frac{\vpolyN(X)}{X-\xi^i}}$ for all $i\in [N]$.
The quotients can be computed in time $O(N\log N)$ using the techniques in ~\cite{EPRINT:FeiKho23}. Using $\kzg$ commitment
scheme the polynomial relations over $Z_\setV$ can be checked in a standard manner
by having the prover send evaluation proofs for the committed polynomials at a random point chosen by the verifier.
The total prover effort incurred is $O(m^2)$ group and field operations.
Thus, we have:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:comm-index-lookup}
Assuming $\kzg$ is extractable polynomial commitment scheme, there exists a succinct argument of knowledge for
the relation $\RLOOK$ with prover complexity of $O(m^2)$, given access to pre-computed parameters of size $O(N)$.
\end{lemma}

\subsubsection{Committed Index Lookup: Generic Transformation}\label{subsubsec:generic-transformation}
The protocol for committed index lookup using Caulk+ ~\cite{EPRINT:PosKat22} can become prohibitive for higher values of
$m$ due to the quadratic dependence on it. Here we describe a generic transformation, which realizes a committed index lookup
argument from any sub-vector argument such as ~\cite{CCS:ZBKMNS22,EPRINT:PosKat22,EPRINT:ZGKMR22,EPRINT:EagFioGab22} using a homo-morphic
vector commitment scheme. We recall that $\vec{a}\in \F^m$ is called a sub-vector of $\vec{b}\in \F^n$ if each element of $\vec{a}$
also occurs in $\vec{b}$. We use $\vec{a}\leq \vec{b}$ to denote $\vec{a}$ is a sub-vector of $\vec{b}$.
The transformation follows from the observation in the following lemma:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:generic-transformation}
Let $\vec{t}\in \F^n$ and let $\vec{a},\vec{v}\in \F^m$ for some positive integers $m,n$. Let $\vec{I}_n$ denote the vector $(1,\ldots,n)$.
Then for $\gamma\gets \F$, $\vec{a}\leq \vec{I}_n$, $\vec{v}\leq \vec{t}$ and $(\vec{v}+\gamma \vec{a})\leq (\vec{t} + \gamma \vec{I}_n)$ implies
$\vec{v}=\vec{t}[\,\vec{a}\,]$ except with probability $O(n/|\F|)$.
\end{lemma}
The proof of the Lemma appears in Section ~\ref{sec:generic-transformation-app}.
Using Lemma ~\ref{lem:generic-transformation}, allows construction of argument for proving $\vec{v}=\vec{t}[\,\vec{a}\,]$ using three instantiations
of a sub-vector argument. We require homomorphism of the commitment scheme to enable the verifier to compute commitments for $\vec{v}+\gamma \vec{a}$ and
$\vec{t} + \gamma \vec{I}_n$ for the final instantiation of sub-vector argument. In particular, we also benchmark committed index lookup
protocol using lookup argument in ~\cite{EPRINT:EagFioGab22}, which incurs prover complexity of $O(m\log m)$.

\subsection{Almost Identical RAM States}\label{subsec:proximity-ram}
For a vector $\vec{a}\in [N]^m$, let $\uniq{a}=\{a_i: i\in [m]\}$ denote the subset of unique values in $\vec{a}$. We call two
RAM states $\vecT, \vecT'\in \F^N$ to be $\vec{a}$-{\em identical} if $\vecT[i]=\vecT'[i]$ for all $i\not\in\uniq{a}$. As before,
let $T(X),T'(X)$ and $a(X)$ be polynomials encoding the vectors $\vecT,\vecT'$ (over $\setN$) and $\vec{a}$ (over $\setV$). Given
commitments $c_T, c_T'$ and $c_a$ polynomial protocol to prove that committed vectors $\vecT,\vecT'\in \F^N$ and $\vec{a}\in \F^m$
are such that $\vecT,\vecT'$ are $\vec{a}$-identical involves proving the relation $Z_I(X)(T(X) - T'(X)) = 0$ over $Z_\setN$ where
$I=\uniq{a}$ and $Z_I(X)=\prod_{i\in I}(X-\xi^i)$ denotes the vanishing polynomial for the set $\setN_I=\{\xi^i: i\in I\}$.
The prover commits to polynomial $Z_I$ and proves (i) $Z_I(T - T') = 0 \text{ mod } Z_\setN$ and (ii) $Z_I$ is the vanishing
polynomial of the set $\setN_I$ as defined. To prove the first relation, the prover computes the polynomial $Q(X)$ as below:
\begin{align}\label{eq:poly-q}
D(X) &= \frac{(T(X)-T'(X))\cdot Z_I(X)}{Z_\setN(X)} \nonumber \\
&= \sum_{i\in I}\frac{(t_i - t_i')\mu_i(X)}{Z_\setN(X)} Z_I(X) \nonumber \\
\intertext{ Substituting, $\Delta_i=t_i-t_i'$, $\mu_i(X)=\vpolyN(X)/(\vpolyN'(\xi^i)(X-\xi^i))$ }
&=\sum_{i\in I}\frac{\Delta_i}{Z_\setN'(\xi^i)}\left(\frac{Z_I(X)}{X-\xi^i}\right) = \sum_{i\in I}\frac{\Delta_i Z_I'(\xi^i)}{Z_\setN'(\xi^i)}\kappa_i(X)
\end{align}
In the above, the summation only runs over indices in $I$, as $\Delta i = 0$ for $i\not\in I$. In the final equality, we use
$\kappa_i(X) = Z_I(X)/(Z_I'(\xi^i)(X-\xi^i))$ for $i\in I$ which we recognize as the lagrange basis polynomials for the set
$\{\xi^i: i\in I\}$. Thus, Equation \eqref{eq:poly-q} implies that $D(X)$ is at most degree $|I|-1$ polynomial, with
$D(\xi^i)=\Delta_i Z_I'(\xi^i)/\vpolyN'(\xi^i)$ for $i\in I$.
The prover can therefore interpolate $D(X)$ (in power basis)
in $O(|I|\log^2 |I|)$ $\F$-operations and compute $\gone{D(X)}$ in $O(|I|)$ $\Gone$-operations. The prover sends the
commitment $\gone{D(X)}$ to the verifier. Finally, the verifier can
check the identity $Z_I(T - T') = D\cdot Z_\setN$ by a pairing check. For this, since the tables are committed in $\Gone$, prover will need to send $\elttwo{Z_I(X)}$.

Next, the prover needs to show that $Z_I(X)$ is indeed the vanishing polynomial of $\setN_I$.
We again use the polynomial $h(X)=\sum_{i=1}^m \xi^{a_i}\tau_i(X)$ which interpolates the vector $(\xi^{a_1},\ldots,\xi^{a_m})$.
The correctness of the $h$ polynomial can be established by checking the polynomial identities in the last two rows of Equation
~\eqref{eq:poly-comm-index}. The aforementioned identities show that $Z_I(h(X)) = 0$ over $Z_\setV$ which shows that $Z_I$ vanishes over
entire vector interpolated by $h$ over $\setV$. To assert that $Z_I$ has no additional roots, the prover commits to the product polynomial
$K(X)=\prod_{i=1}^m (X - h(\nu^i))$ and the quotient polynomial $q(X)=K(X)/Z_I(X)$. The verifier checks the polynomial identities
at $\alpha$, i.e $K(\alpha)=q(\alpha)Z_I(\alpha)$ and $K(\alpha)=\prod_{i=1}^m(\alpha - h(\nu^i))$.
The former is easily accomplished
using evaluation proofs for $K,q$ and $Z_I$ at $\alpha$
For checking the latter, the prover commits to another polynomial
$u(X)$ satisfying $u(\nu^i)=\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}\big((\alpha - h(\nu^j))/(1 + \beta\tau_1(\nu^j))\big)$ for $i\in [m]$
where $\beta=K(\alpha) - 1$.
The verifier ensures the correctness of $u(X)$ by
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \tau_1(X)(u(X) - 1) &= 0 \text{ mod } Z_{\setV} \\
        u(\nu X)(1+\beta \tau_1(X))-u(X)(\alpha - h(X)) &= 0 \text{ mod } Z_\setV.
    \end{aligned}
    \label{eq:kh-check}
\end{equation}
We prove that the above constraints imply that $K(\alpha)=\prod_{i\in [m]}(\alpha - h(\nu^i))$.
Note that in this protocol we require commitment to the polynomial $Z_I$ in both $\Gone$ and $\Gtwo$,
and thus another pairing check is required to show that the $Z_I(X)$ committed in $\Gone$
(whose well formation is shown in the protocol as described above) is the same as the $Z_I(X)$ committed in $\Gtwo$,
used for the real pairing check.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:kh-check}
There exists a polynomial $u(X)\in \F[X]$ satisfying the identities in Equation ~\eqref{eq:kh-check}
if and only if $K(\alpha)=1+\beta=\prod_{i\in [m]} (\alpha - h(\nu^i))$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    Assume that the identitites hold for some polynomial $u(X)$.
    The first identity implies $u(\nu)=1$. From the second identity, we conclude that for all $i\in [m]$, we have
    $u(\nu^{i+1})=u(\nu^i)\cdot ((\alpha - h(\nu^i))/(1+\beta \tau_1(\nu^i)))$, and thus:
    $$1 = u(\nu^{m+1})/u(\nu) = \prod_{i\in [m]}\left(\frac{\alpha - h(\nu^i)}{1+\beta \tau_1(\nu^i)}\right).$$
    We observe that the product of denominators in the above equation is simply $1+\beta$ as $\tau_1(\nu^i)$
    is $0$ for all $i\neq 1$, and thus $1+\beta = \prod_{i=1}^m (\alpha - h(\nu^i))$. In the other direction,
    it is easy to check that $u(X)$ as defined for an honest prover, satisfies the identities in Equation ~\ref{eq:kh-check}.
\end{proof}

\noindent{\em Remark}: Note that we incur $O(m^2)$ cost if we show the correctness of polynomial $h$ using techniques of Section ~\ref{subsec:committed-index-lookup}.
However, we can use more $O(m\log m)$ complexity committed index lookup obtained from ~\cite{EPRINT:EagFioGab22}, which allows us to show correctness of
$h(X)$ by proving that it interpolates vector $\vec{h}$ on $\setV$ obtained as committed index lookup using vector $\vec{a}$ on the vector $\vecT_{exp}=(\xi,\xi^2,\ldots,\xi^N)$
i.e., $\vec{h}=\vecT_{exp}[\, \vec{a}\,]$.

\subsection{Batching-Efficient RAM: Combined Protocol}\label{subsec:all-together}
We put the entire protocol together now. Let $\setind$ denote the set of indices $\{1,\ldots,N\}$, and $\mathcal{I}_N$
denote the vector $(1,\ldots,N)$. We formally define the committed RAM relation for which we present an argument of
knowledge in this section.
\begin{definition}\label{defn:committed-ram}
We define the {\em committed ram} relation
$\CRAM$ to consist of tuples $((c_T, c_T', c_\op, c_a, c_w),(\vecT, \vecT',\vec{\op},\vec{a},\vec{w}))$
such that:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]
    \item $(T,\vec{o},T')\in \LRAM{I}{N}{m}$ for $T=(\setind_N,\vecT)$, $T'=(\setind_N,\vecT')$ and $\vec{o}=(o_1,\ldots,o_m)$
    where $o_i=(\op_i, a_i, w_i)\in \RAMOp{I}$ for all $i\in [m]$.
    \item $c_T=\KZGcommit(\srs, T(X))$, $c_T'=\KZGcommit(\srs, T'(X))$, $c_\op = \KZGcommit(\srs,\op(X))$,  $c_a=\KZGcommit(\srs, a(X))$,
    $c_w = \KZGcommit(\srs, w(X))$ where polynomials $T(X), T'(X)$ encode vectors $\vecT, \vecT'$ over $\setN$, while $\op(X), a(X)$ and
    $w(X)$ encode vectors $\vec{\op}=(\op_1,\ldots,\op_m)$, $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{w}$ over $\setV$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
As outlined in the blueprint, the prover first commits to ``smaller'' RAMs $S=(\vec{a},\vec{v})$ and $S'=(\vec{a},\vec{v}')$
where $\vec{v}=\vecT[\vec{a}]$ and $\vec{v}'=\vecT'[\vec{a}]$. The prover commits to $S$ and $S'$ by sending commitments
$c_v$ and $c_v'$ to $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{v}'$. Then the prover and verifier execute the committed index lookup protocol to
prove:
\begin{equation}
(c_T, c_a, c_v)\in \RLOOK\, \wedge\, (c_T', c_a, c_v')\in \RLOOK
\end{equation}
The verifier uses a random challenge $\chi\gets \F$ to reduce two instances of $\RLOOK$ to one instance
$(c_T + \chi c_T', c_a, c_v + \chi c_v')\in \RLOOK$. Then, we show that
RAMs $\vecT$ and $\vecT'$ are $\vec{a}$-identical using the protocol in Section \ref{subsec:proximity-ram}.
All that remains is to prove is that the operation sequence $\vec{o}$ is consistent with small RAMs $S$ and $S'$.
We check this using the argument in Section ~\ref{sec:poly-proto-ram}. Specifically, the prover and the verifier set
$c_S = (c_a, c_v)$, $c_S'=(c_a, c_v')$ and $c_o = (c_\op, c_a, c_w)$, and execute the argument of knowledge for
showing $(c_S, c_o, c_S')\in \CLRAM$ (see Definition ~\ref{defn:committed-ram}). We provide the complete protocol
listing in Figure ~\ref{fig:complete-listing}. The protocol in Figure ~\ref{fig:complete-listing} assumes pre-computed parameters
for the tables $T$ and $T'$. In the next section, we discuss how to efficiently maintain table-dependent parameters in the setting
requiring updates to the table.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:committed-ram}
The protocol in Figure~\ref{fig:complete-listing} (continued in Figures~\ref{fig:complete-listing-2} and
~\ref{fig:complete-listing-3}) is a succinct argument of knowledge for the relation $\CLRAM$ in
the AGM, under the $Q$-DLOG assumption for the bilinear group $(\F,\Gone,\Gtwo,\GT,e,g_1,g_2)$.
