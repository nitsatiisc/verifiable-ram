\end{figure}

The construction in the previous section results in prover complexity which is quasi-linear in both the
size of the RAM and the number of operations.
Our goal in this section is to achieve prover complexity which is {\em sublinear} in the size of the RAM.
In what follows, let $N$ denote the size of the RAM (upper-case to signify it's large) and $m$ denote the number
of operations in a batch. We will use a vectors in $\F^N$ to denote the ``large'' RAMs, where index column is implicitly
assumed to be $(1,\ldots,N)$.
Let $\vec{T},\vec{T'}\in \F^N$ denote the initial and final RAM states, and let $\vec{o}$ be
a sequence of $m$ operations which updates $\vec{T}$ to $\vec{T}'$. Let $\vec{a}\in \F^m$ denote the vector
of RAM indices referenced by the operations in $\vec{o}$, i.e, $a_i$ is the index referenced by $i^{th}$ operation.
To prove the transformation of $\vec{T}$ to $\vec{T}'$ via operation sequence $\vec{o}$, we proceed as follows:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=2em, label=-]
\item We isolate sub-tables $S=(\vec{a},\vec{v})$ and $S'=(\vec{a},\vec{a'})$ of $T$ and $T'$ consisting of
rows corresponding to indices in $\vec{a}$. This requires proving $\vec{v}=\vecT[\vec{a}]$ and $\vec{v'}=
\vecT'[\vec{a}]$, which we show using {\em committed index lookup} discussed in Section ~\ref{subsec:committed-index-lookup}.

\item On the isolated sub-table $S$ and $S'$ of size $m$, we use the standard memory checking arguments (c.f. argument
presented in Section \ref{sec:poly-proto-ram-app}) to prove that sequence $\vec{o}$ correctly updates $S$ to $S'$ with
prover complexity of $\wt{O}(m)$.

\item Finally, we show that the RAMs $T$ and $T'$ are identical outside indices in $\vec{a}$. We call them $\vec{a}$-identical
and describe the protocol for proving the same in Section ~\ref{subsec:proximity-ram}.
\end{itemize}
The above blueprint is illustrated in Figure ~\ref{fig:blueprint}.

The efficiency of the above approach relies crucially on the efficiency of committed index lookup used to
reduce the size of the RAMs for quasi-linear memory checking methods.
Using recently developed lookup arguments directly is difficult, as their efficiency relies on
table specific expensive pre-computation, which does not help when the table itself is being updated.
To circumvent this, we design a lookup argument, which efficiently proves lookup with access to pre-computed
parameters for a ``nearby'' table. In particular, we show that lookup protocols in
~\cite{CCS:ZBKMNS22,EPRINT:PosKat22,EPRINT:EagFioGab22} can be used to show $m$ lookups from a table $\vecT'$, given pre-computed parameters
for a table $\vecT$ with additional overhead of $O((m+\delta)\log^2 (m+\delta))$, where $\delta$ denotes the number of positions where
$\vecT$ and $\vecT'$ differ (hamming distance). By optimally deferring the $O(N\log N)$ re-computation till we
accumulate $\delta \approx \sqrt{mN}$ updates, we achieve an amortized prover overhead $O(\sqrt{mN})$ over the read-only protocol.
This modification, which applies to all the aforementioned lookup protocols is described in Section ~\ref{sec:update-protocol}.

\noindent{\bf Additional Notation}:
Before proceeding, we introduce the subgroup $\setN=\{\xi,\ldots,\xi^N\}$ consisting of $N^{th}$ roots of unity,
over which we encode vectors in $\F^N$ as polynomials of degree less than $N$. Let $\{\mu_i(X)\}_{i=1}^N$ be the associated
lagrange basis polynomials over the set $\setN$. We also recall the set $\setV$ consisting of $m^{th}$ roots of unity
$\nu,\ldots,\nu^m$ with associated lagrange polynomials as $\{\tau_i(X)\}_{i=1}^m$. For $\vec{f}\in \F^N$, let
$\enc{f}{\setN}$ denote the polynomial encoding of $\vec{f}$ over $\setN$ given by $\sum_{i=1}^N f_i\mu_i(X)$. Similarly,
for $\vec{g}\in \F^m$, let $\enc{g}{\setV}$ denote its polynomial encoding over $\setV$ given by $\sum_{i=1}^m g_i\tau_i(X)$.


\subsection{Committed Index Lookup}\label{subsec:committed-index-lookup}
Let $m,N\in \N$ with $m < N$ and let $\srs$ denote a $\kzg$ setup over bilinear group $(\Gone,\Gtwo,\GT,\gone{1},\gtwo{1},e)$
large enough to commit to polynomials of degree $<N$. Prior works on lookup arguments (~\cite{CCS:ZBKMNS22,EPRINT:PosKat22} etc.)
have considered proving sub-vector relation over committed vectors, i.e, given commitments $c_t$ and $c_v$ to vectors $\vec{t}\in \F^N$
and $\vec{v}\in \F^m$, one proves that for all $i\in [m]$, there exists $j\in [N]$ such that $v_i=t_j$ .
We consider a slightly modified relation,
called {\em committed index lookup}  which also commits to indices where $\vec{v}$ appears in $\vec{t}$.

\begin{definition}\label{defn:comm-index-lookup}
We define the {\em committed index lookup} relation $\RLOOK$ to consist of tuples
$((c_t,c_a,c_v),(\vec{t},\vec{a},\vec{v}))$ where $c_t,c_a,c_v\in \Gone$, $\vec{t}\in \F^N$, $\vec{a},\vec{v}\in \F^m$ such
that $v_i = \vec{t}[a_i]=t_{a_i}$ for all $i\in [m]$ and $c_t = \kzgcommit(\srs, \enc{t}{\setN})$, $c_a=\kzgcommit(\srs,\enc{a}{\setV})$
and $c_v=\kzgcommit(\srs,\enc{v}{\setV})$.
\end{definition}

We present a polynomial protocol for the above relation, which is an adaptation of the lookup protocol from Caulk+ ~\cite{EPRINT:PosKat22}
to the indexed lookup case. Moreover, we do not aim for zero-knowledge. Let $T(X)=\enc{t}{\setN}$, $a(X)=\enc{a}{\setV}$ and
$v(X)=\enc{v}{\setV}$ denote the polynomials encoding the vectors $\vec{t},\vec{a}$ and $\vec{v}$ respectively. The prover commits
to these polynomials. Now $v_i = \vec{t}[a_i]$ for $i\in [m]$ is equivalent to $v(\nu^i) = T(\xi^{a(\nu^i)})$ for $i\in [m]$. To
obtain a polynomial protocol, the prover interpolates a polynomial $h(X)=\sum_{i=1}^m \xi^{a_i}\tau_i(X)$, which satisfies
$h(\nu^i)=\xi^{a(\nu^i)}$. To show that polynomial $h$ correctly ``exponentiates'' evaluations of $a(X)$, we consider the
polynomial $\ell(X)=\sum_{i=1}^N i\mu_i(X)$ which behaves like ``log'' over $\setN$ by evaluating to $i$ on $\xi^i$. Now, we see
that all constraints are encoded as polynomial identities below:
\begin{alignat}{3}
\ell(h(X)) &= a(X) \quad \text{mod } Z_{\setV}(X) & \quad\text{ encodes } & \quad \forall i\in [m]:& h(\nu^i) = \xi^{a(\nu^i)}  \\
T(h(X)) &= v(X) \quad \text{mod } Z_\setV(X) & \quad\text{ encodes } & \quad \forall i\in [m]:& v_i = \vec{t}[a_i] \\
Z_{\setN}(h(X)) &= 0 \quad \text{mod } Z_\setV(X)  &\quad\text{ encodes } & \quad \forall i \in [m]:& h(\nu^i)\in \setN
\end{alignat}
The above formulation involves composition with polynomials $\ell,T$ and $\vpolyN$ of degree $O(N)$, which is inefficient. We use the trick from
\cite{EPRINT:PosKat22}, where we work with low-degree restrictions of polynomials such as $T, \ell$ over the set
$\setN_I=\{{h(\nu^i)}: i\in I\}=\{\xi^{a_i}:i\in I\}\subseteq \setN$, where $I=\{a_i: i\in [m]\}$. To this end, the prover
commits to the polynomial $Z_I(X)=\prod_{i\in I}(X-\xi^i)$, and low degree ($<m$) restrictions $T_I, \ell_I$ of $T$ and $\ell$
on $\setN_I$ respectively. The polynomial protocol then checks the following:
\begin{alignat}{3}\label{eq:poly-comm-index}
T(X) - T_I(X) &= 0 \quad \text{ mod } Z_I(X) &&,\quad T_I(h(X)) &= v(X) \quad \text{ mod } Z_{\setV}(X) \\
\ell(X) - \ell_I(X) &= 0 \quad \text{ mod } Z_I(X) &&,\quad \ell_I(h(X)) &= a(X) \quad \text{ mod } Z_{\setV}(X) \\
Z_{\setN}(X) &= 0 \quad \text{ mod } Z_I(X) &&,\quad Z_I(h(X)) &= 0 \quad \text{ mod } Z_{\setV}(X)
\end{alignat}
While the identities on the left still involve a degree $N$ polynomial, we can use the $\srs$ to check the polynomial
identity at the point $\tau$ encoded in the $\srs$. For example, we can evaluate the encoded quotient $\gtwo{Q(X)} =$
$\gtwo{\frac{(T(X) - T_I(X)}{Z_I(X)}}$ using the relation:
\begin{equation*}
\gtwo{\frac{T(X)-T_I(X)}{Z_I(X)}} = \sum_{i\in I}\frac{1}{Z_I'(\xi^i)}\gtwo{\frac{T(X)-t_i}{X-\xi^i}}
\end{equation*}
By pre-computing the $\kzg$ proofs $W_1^i=\gtwo{\frac{T(X)-t_i}{X-\xi^i}}$ for all $i\in [N]$, the encoded quotient can be
evaluated using $O(m)$ $\Gtwo$-operations and $O(m\log^2 m)$ $\F$-operations. The identity is then checked using a real
pairing check $e(\gone{T(X)}-\gone{T_I(X)},\gtwo{1})=e(\gone{Z_I(X)},\gtwo{Q(X)})$.
Similarly, we also pre-compute the encoded
quotients $W_2^i=\gtwo{\frac{\ell(X) - i}{X-\xi^i}}$ and $W_3^i=\gtwo{\frac{\vpolyN(X)}{X-\xi^i}}$ for all $i\in [N]$.
The quotients can be computed in time $O(N\log N)$ using the techniques in ~\cite{EPRINT:FeiKho23}.
The polynomial relations over $Z_\setV$ can be checked in a standard manner via evaluations at a random point with $O(m^2)$ prover effort.
Thus, we have:
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:comm-index-lookup}
Assuming $\kzg$ is extractable polynomial commitment scheme, there exists a succinct argument of knowledge for
the relation $\RLOOK$ with prover complexity of $O(m^2)$, given access to pre-computed parameters of size $O(N)$.
\end{lemma}

\subsection{Proximity of RAM States}\label{subsec:proximity-ram}
For a vector $\vec{a}\in [N]^m$, let $\uniq{a}=\{a_i: i\in [m]\}$ denote the subset of unique values in $\vec{a}$. We call two
RAM states $\vecT, \vecT'\in \F^N$ to be $\vec{a}$-{\em identical} if $\vecT[i]=\vecT'[i]$ for all $i\not\in\uniq{a}$. As before,
let $T(X),T'(X)$ and $a(X)$ be polynomials encoding the vectors $\vecT,\vecT'$ (over $\setN$) and $\vec{a}$ (over $\setV$). The
polynomial protocol involves proving the relation $Z_I(X)(T(X) - T'(X)) = 0$ over $Z_\setN$ where $Z_I(X)=\prod_{i\in I}(X-\xi^i)$
for $I=\uniq{a}$ denotes the vanishing polynomial over the support of $\vec{a}$.
The prover commits to polynomial $Z_I$ and proves (i) $Z_I(T - T') = 0 \text{ mod } Z_\setH$ and (ii) $Z_I$ is the vanishing
polynomial of the support of vector $\vec{a}$. To prove the first relation, the prover computes the polynomial $Q(X)$ as below:
\begin{align}\label{eq:poly-q}
Q(X) &= \frac{(T(X)-T'(X))\cdot Z_I(X)}{Z_\setN(X)} \nonumber \\
&= \sum_{i\in I}\frac{(t_i - t_i')\mu_i(X)}{Z_\setN(X)} Z_I(X) \nonumber \\
\intertext{ Substituting, $\Delta_i=t_i-t_i'$, $\mu_i(X)=\vpolyN(X)/(\vpolyN'(\xi^i)(X-\xi^i))$ }
&=\sum_{i\in I}\frac{\Delta_i}{Z_\setN'(\xi^i)}\left(\frac{Z_I(X)}{X-\xi^i}\right) = \sum_{i\in I}\frac{\Delta_i Z_I'(\xi^i)}{Z_\setN'(\xi^i)}\kappa_i(X)
\end{align}
In the above, the summation only runs over indices in $I$, as $t_i=t_i'$ for $i\not\in I$. In the final equality, we use
$\kappa_i(X) = Z_I(X)/(Z_I'(\xi^i)(X-\xi^i))$ for $i\in I$ which we recognize as the lagrange basis polynomials for the set
$\{\xi^i: i\in I\}$. Thus, Equation \eqref{eq:poly-q} implies that $Q$ is a degree $|I|-1$ polynomial, with
$Q(\xi^i)=\Delta_i Z_I'(\xi^i)/\vpolyN'(\xi^i)$ for $i\in I$. The prover can therefore interpolate $Q(X)$ (in power basis)
in $O(|I|\log^2 |I|)$ $\F$-operations and compute $\gtwo{Q(X)}$ in $O(|I|)$ $\Gtwo$-operations.

Next, the prover needs to show that $Z_I(X)$ is indeed the vanishing polynomial of $\setN_I=\{\xi^i: i\in I\}$ where $I=\uniq{a}$.
We again use the polynomial $h(X)=\sum_{i=1}^m \xi^{a_i}\tau_i(X)$ which interpolates the vector $(\xi^{a_1},\ldots,\xi^{a_m})$.
The correctness of the $h$ polynomial can be established using the restriction $\ell_I$ of ``log'' polynomial $\ell$ as before.
We show that $Z_I(h(X)) = 0$ over $Z_\setV$ which shows that $Z_I$ vanishes over entire vector interpolated
by $h$. To assert that $Z_I$ has no additional roots, the prover commits to the product polynomial
$K(X)=\prod_{i=1}^m (X - h(\nu^i))$ and the quotient polynomial $q(X)=K(X)/Z_I(X)$. The verifier checks the polynomial identities
at $\alpha$, i.e $K(\alpha)=q(\alpha)Z_I(\alpha)$ and $K(\alpha)=\prod_{i=1}^m(\alpha - h(\nu^i))$. The former is easily accomplished
using evaluation proofs for $K,q$ and $Z_I$ at $\alpha$. For checking the latter, the prover commits to another polynomial
$u(X)$ satisfying $u(\nu^i)=\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}\big((\alpha - h(\nu^j))/(1 + \beta\tau_1(\nu^j))\big)$ for $i\in [m]$
where $\beta=K(\alpha) - 1$.
The verifier ensures the correctness of $u(X)$ by checking:
\begin{align*}
\tau_1(X)(u(X) - 1) &= 0 \text{ mod } Z_{\setV} \\
u(\nu X)(1+\beta \tau_1(X))-u(X)(\alpha - h(X)) &= 0 \text{ mod } Z_\setV.
\end{align*}
Note that the constraints on $u(X)$ essentially
ensure that $K(\alpha)\cdot 1\cdots 1 = (\alpha - h(\nu))\cdots (\alpha - h(\nu^m))$, which follows from the fact that
$u(\nu)=u(\nu^{m+1})=1$.

\subsection{Batching Efficient RAM: Combined Protocol}\label{subsec:all-together}
We put the entire protocol together now. Let $\setind$ denote the set of indices $\{1,\ldots,N\}$, and $\mathcal{I}_N$
denote the vector $(1,\ldots,N)$. We formally define the committed RAM relation for which we present the argument of
knowledge in this section.
\begin{definition}\label{defn:committed-ram}
We define the {\em committed ram} relation
$\CRAM$ to consist of tuples $((c_T, c_T', c_\op, c_a, c_w),(\vecT, \vecT',\vec{\op},\vec{a},\vec{w}))$
such that:
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=1em]
\item $(T,\vec{o},T')\in \LRAM{I}{N}{m}$ for $T=(\setind_N,\vecT)$, $T'=(\setind_N,\vecT')$ and $\vec{o}=(o_1,\ldots,o_m)$
where $o_i=(\op_i, a_i, w_i)\in \RAMOp{I}$ for all $i\in [m]$.
\item $c_T=\kzgcommit(\srs,\enc{T}{\setN})$, $c_T'=\kzgcommit(\srs,\enc{T'}{\setN})$, $c_\op=\kzgcommit(\srs,\enc{\op}{\setV})$,
$c_a=\kzgcommit(\srs,\enc{a}{\setV})$ and $c_w$ $=$ \\ $\kzgcommit(\srs,\enc{w}{\setV})$.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
As outlined in the blueprint, the prover first commits to ``smaller'' RAMs $S=(\vec{a},\vec{v})$ and $S'=(\vec{a},\vec{v}')$
where $\vec{v}=\vecT[\vec{a}]$ and $\vec{v}'=\vecT'[\vec{a}]$. The prover commits to $S$ and $S'$ by sending commitments
$c_v$ and $c_v'$ to $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{v}'$. Then the prover and verifier execute the committed index lookup protocol to
prove:
\begin{equation}
(c_T, c_a, c_v)\in \RLOOK\, \wedge\, (c_T', c_a, c_v')\in \RLOOK
\end{equation}
The verifier uses a random challenge $\chi\gets \F$ to reduce two instances of $\RLOOK$ to one instance
$(c_T + \chi c_T', c_a, c_v + \chi c_v')\in \RLOOK$. Thereafter, the prover and verifier execute the argument for
showing $(S,\vec{o},S')\in \LRAM{I}{m}{m}$ as described in Section \ref{subsec:succ-args}. Finally, we show that
RAMs $\vecT$ and $\vecT'$ are $\vec{a}$-identical using the protocol in Section \ref{subsec:proximity-ram}.
